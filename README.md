Rendering OpenGL flowers in C++ and Java (in future). Currently there are two versions available -- Win32, last compiled with Visual Studio 7.1, and a GCC / MinGW, which I also tested only on Windows so far.

There's a Win32 binary in cpp/dist-win32 folder for those who feel like running .exe files downloaded from Internet :)

Disclaimer: I wrote it in 2003 -- 2004, so please don't take it too seriously.
